# To-Do List App

This is a simple To-Do List app built using React.js, allowing users to add, complete, and delete tasks. The tasks are organized into three sections: Active, Completed, and Deleted tasks.

## Features
- **Add Tasks:** Users can input tasks into the list using the input field.
- **Mark as Completed:** Users can mark tasks as completed, which moves them to the "Completed" section.
- **Delete Tasks:** Users can delete tasks, moving them to the "Deleted" section.
- **Organized Layout:** Tasks are categorized into Active, Completed, and Deleted sections for better task management.
